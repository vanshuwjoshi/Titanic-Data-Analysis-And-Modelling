# Kaggle Titanic Data Science Project

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. In this project, I performed various data analysis, data visualization, data wrangling, and data modeling tasks using supervised machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. The dataset provided by Kaggle contains information about the passengers, including whether they survived or not.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, gain insights from it, and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers based on various features.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` directory. You can also download it from Kaggle's Titanic competition page: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
